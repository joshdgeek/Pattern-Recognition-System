i just had to make this code to work ,
forgive me for the messy codes
the code will undergo adjustment with time
## ALGORITHM:
 i created an empty array 
 i declared some variables "one,two add and mult" for conditional statement handling
 performed a recursive algorithm to revisit the new array after splicing the first character and running the conditional statements.
!! thats the basic idea of the project;

## how to use the program
You use the "click to input values" button  to input your integers in which you wish to get the order of its pattern;
Then you click "submit";
You could also cancel an entry using the edit " button";
NOTE : It doesnt collect characters that are not integers,if you try ,it wont add it to its list of test cases (number)
